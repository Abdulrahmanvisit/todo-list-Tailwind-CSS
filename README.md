To-Do Tailwind CSS:
Welcome to my simple and stylish To-Do app.
it's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
The goal is to help you manage your daily tasks with ease while keeping things clean and modern

What this project does:
you can add tasks, mark them as done, and remove them when you no longer need them.
it's lightweight, responsive, and works well across different devices.

Why I built it:
I made this project to practice Tailwind CSS and sharpen my JavaScript skills.
it also gave me a chance to explore how to build interactive web apps that look neat and feel smooth to use.

What I learned
styling quickly with Tailwind's utility classes
Handling events in the browser with JavaScript
Keeping code organized and easy to read
Using Git and Github for version control

A note from me:
Thanks for checking out my project.
I’m always learning and improving, so I’d love to hear your feedback or suggestions.
If you find this helpful or inspiring, let me know — it means a lot.
